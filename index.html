                <h2>Topic 1</h2>
                <p>This topic refreshed me from my Junior High School IT Class, at least on the basic ones. As I incorporate my capabilities in editing digitals to my computer course, I have somehow felt the sense of satisfaction and relief. <br></br>
                This course discussed the ages of computer inventions and their respective inventors in late centuries. It also discussed the uses, purpose, and significance in modern society.</p>

                <h2>Topic 2: Information Processing Cycle and Computer Systems</h2>
                <p>In this topic, we discussed about data and information processing, we discussed its cycle and its characteristics. Learning its phases and processes made me think to myself that the process of everything is very meticulous and should be organized or else it won't be read.</p>

                <h2>Topic 3: Information Processing Cycle and Computer Systems</h2>
                <p>During this topic, we learned about the systems, components, and the classifications of computer. Through this lecture,<br>
                I refreshed my past learnings about different categories of a computer's components, where I remember now where classify a specific part.</br></p>

                <h2>Topic 4</h2>
                <p>This topic taught us the basic concepts of computer security and the different kinds of cybercrimes. We also learned the terminologies of the cybercriminals in different crimes they've committed. 
                    Through this, I realized that I have actually committed few crimes that could potentially be a major cause of my trip behind the bars if I will take a wrong turn.

                <h3>Topic 6</h3>
                <p>This topic introduced us to HTML and CSS. As for me, it's a nostalgic experience to make an HTML CSS website like it's a first time. I am lowkey excited on this topic because I've always liked to delve
                    in creating mini websites, and I tried few of those using carrd.co site. As of now, I am challenging myself to create a website using vast and complex programs with complex syntaxes.

                <p>After the introduction of HTML and CSS customs, we were tasked to create a wireframe for our desired website output. I'm sure I did that wrong during submissions but at least I got to learn how to make a proper wireframe.</p>
